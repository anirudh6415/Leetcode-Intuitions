| - | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1 | Longest Increasing Subsequence           | <p>Recursive: 1. Start with 0, -1.<br>2. Element in index is greater than previous, include it or skip element.<br>3. Find max(include and exclude).<br>4. Base: index == len(nums), return 0.</p> | Solution       |
|   |                                          | Tabulation DP: Fill a table where each index represents the longest increasing subsequence up to that point.                                                                                       |                |
|   |                                          | Memoization DP: Use a helper function with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.                                                                                                            |                |
| 2 | Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence | Recursive: Intuition based on counting the number of subsequences that can be formed.                                                                                                              | Solution       |
|   |                                          | Tabulation DP: Use a table to count the number of subsequences ending at each index.                                                                                                               |                |
|   |                                          | Memoization DP: Optimize the recursive approach using memoization.                                                                                                                                 |                |
